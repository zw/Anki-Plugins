<h1>CodeInCards - an Anki plugin to embed Python code in cards/card templates</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> plugin loads substition
"libraries" of <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> functions and variables from
<span class="code">%pluginsFolder%/CodeInCards/*.py</span>
then provides syntax to let you substitute the results of library calls (or indeed
any other arbitrary Python code) into cards and/or card templates.
</p>

<p>
You won't be able to do much with this plugin without some Python and/or
programming experience, or a geeky friend who's <a href="fix.jpg">very generous with their time</a>
(and writing escapes/libraries for Anki is not a good way to start learning
&mdash; see <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">the Python Beginners' Guide</a>
for that).  On the other hand, if you do have the experience then you have the
full power of Python at your disposal.
</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p style="color:red; font-size:larger">Warning: This plugin is a potential
security hole.  Please don't install it until you've read and understood
the explanation below and weighed up the risks.</p>

<p>
Like any feature that provides ways to execute code, installing this plugin
turns every deck into a potential security hole, just as turning on macros
in a spreadsheet program does.  If someone/something deliberately or
accidentally causes you to run CodeInCards escapes you didn't write, or even if
you just write buggy escapes, it could lead to you losing data and/or control
of your computer (e.g. getting infected with viruses and trojans).
</p>

<p>
To minimise this risk, CodeInCards will only execute escapes in decks it
trusts.  Decks are untrusted by default and use of escapes in an untrusted deck
will generate a warning message instead of running them.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
Download using <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/Plugins">Anki's plugin
browser</a> in the normal way; search for "codeincards".  You may also want to
look at the <a href="http://github.com/zw/Anki-Plugins/blob/master/CodeInCards/default.py">example library</a>
for inspiration.  You can also <a href="http://github.com/zw/Anki-Plugins/raw/master/CodeInCards/default.py">download this library</a>
and save it in the <span class="code">%pluginsFolder%/CodeInCards/</span>
directory if you'd like to try it.
</p>

<h2>Trust</h2>

<p>
To trust a deck use "Tools&rarr;Advanced&rarr;CodeInCards Deck Trust&hellip;".
<span style="color:red;">
You are strongly advised to trust only those decks which you've built yourself,
from scratch, and which are not shared or synchronised online.  You have been
warned!</span>
</p>

<p>
Deck trust settings are per installation &mdash; a deck trusted by you and
exported/shared will not be trusted by anyone else unless they go through this
step too.  Similarly, if someone e-mails you a deck or you download one, you
would have to explicitly trust it for any CodeInCards escapes to run.  The
deck's creation time and name are used together as an identifier, so if you use
the OS to copy a deck you already trust and give it the same name then the copy
will be trusted too (but again, only by your installation).
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>
Escapes may be included either encoded as HTML or among the markup (i.e. you
can enter them directly in the browser-editor field, or in the "HTML editor" window).
The following escape formats are supported.  The dollar-formats aim for brevity
over flexibility:
</p>

  <div style="color:blue; margin-left:3em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
  $varName
  </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    Interpolate variable "varName".  Subscripting and dot-whatever
    isn't supported (yet!); use the bracketed format below instead.
    </p>

  <div style="color:blue; margin-left:3em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
  $functionName(&hellip;)
  </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    Invoke <span class="code">functionName</span>
    with the supplied args, and interpolate the returned string, e.g.:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      $myFunc(myVar, 'a string arg')
      </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    The args list is considered to stop at the next closing bracket, even if
    it occurs in a string or after a nested function call, so these won't work:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      $wontWork("a (broken) example")<br/>
      $alsoWontWork("some text", anotherFunc())
      </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    &hellip;but see <a href="#fieldsubst">Field Substitution</a> below for an exception.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    If you're intent on sticking with the dollar-format then you can usually
    hack around the string case above using Python's <span class="code">u''</span>
    string format and the escape <span class="code">\u0029</span>,
    or perhaps just the HTML entity <span class="code">&amp;#x0029;</span>:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      $willWork(u"a \u0028working\u0029 example")<br/>
      $willWork("a <span class="code">&amp;#x0028;</span>working<span class="code">&amp;#x0029;</span> example")<br/>
      $stillWontWork("some text", anotherFunc())
      </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    but the function call case still won't work and it might be easier
    just to use the bracketed forms below instead in both cases.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    You can split a function call over multiple lines:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      $quotation('''<br/>
      Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake<br/>
      in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even<br/>
      the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.<br/>
      ''')
      </div>

<p>
The bracketed formats are more flexible but more verbose.  They accept
multiple lines and brackets are allowed; the only banned string is
<span class="code">%}</span>.
</p>

  <div style="color:blue; margin-left:3em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
  {%= &lt;expression&gt; %}
  </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    Evaluates &lt;expression&gt; (a single expression) and substitutes
    result.  For example:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      {%= 6 * 9 %}
      </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; ">
    will yield "54" in the card or template (or "42" if you're a Hitchiker's Guide fan).  Function
    calls also work (brackets and all), e.g.:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      {%= functionName("a (working) example", someOtherFunc()) %}
      </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em; max-width:35em; "></p>

  <div style="color:blue; margin-left:3em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
  {% &lt;code&gt; %}
  </div>
    <p style="margin-left:6em">
    Executes &lt;code&gt;.  Anything printed to <span class="code">sys.stdout</span> gets substituted, e.g.:
    </p>
      <div style="margin-left:9em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
      {%<br/>
      if random.randint(0, 1000000) == 42:<br/>
      <span style="white-space:pre">        print "The Ultimate Answer!"</span><br/>
      %}<br/>
      </div>

<p>
Note that in card templates you'll need to use
<span class="code">{%%&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;%%}</span>
and <span class="code">{%%=&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;%%}</span> instead
because Anki uses <span class="code">%</span> for
field value substitutions (a poor choice of escape characters on my part).
</p>

<p>
You can type a literal '$' as <span class="code">$$</span>.
</p>

<p>
You can separate a simple variable substitution from the surrounding text
without introducing trailing whitespace by using a trailing exclamation mark.
For instance, if <span class="code">ABOUT</span> was set to
<span class="code">"~"</span> then:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">$ABOUTten</span> would give an error.</li>
<li><span class="code">$ABOUT ten</span> would yield "<span class="code">~&nbsp;ten</span>".</li>
<li><span class="code">$ABOUT!ten</span> would yield "<span class="code">~ten</span>" which is probably what you want.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="fieldsubst">Field substitution</h3>

<p>
When you save this in the card template editor:
</p>
  <div style="margin-left:3em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
  $myFunc('foo %(fieldName)s bar')
  </div>
<p>
&hellip;Anki regenerates the HTML for all the cards, which expands
<span class="code">%(fieldName)s</span>
and wraps it in some formatting code.  By the time the card gets rendered
for (p)review and CodeInCards escapes get interpreted, CodeInCards will see
something like this:
</p>
  <div style="margin-left:3em; font-family:Courier,monospace">
  $myFunc('foo &lt;span id="fm109283749"&gt;fieldContents&lt;span&gt; bar')
  </div>
<p>
Provided <span class="code">fieldContents</span>
doesn't contain any brackets itself, this works fine - and is an exception to
the rule that brackets aren't allowed in <span class="code">$fn()</span>
escapes - but you must take care to avoid double-quotes for the argument to
<span class="code">myFunc()</span> to prevent a
clash with Anki's <span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span>
tag attribute.  If your <span class="code">%(string)s</span>
might contain single quotes then you'll have to use Python's tripled quotes
around it.  If it might contain closing brackets then you'll have to use
<span class="code">{%&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;%}</span> syntax.  If it might
contain tripled quotes, that's probably a sign from the Gods.
</p>

<h2>Execution Environment</h2>

<h3 id="escapes">Escapes</h3>
<p>
Code in escapes is executed at the point that the card gets displayed, and also
whenever the card gets displayed in the cards list.  If an escape contains code
with errors then the error will get interpolated as a big red HTML-ised string
every time you (p)review the card.
</p>

<p>
The string "&lt;br /&gt;" is removed from within code if present before
execution.  This allows you to add code in the card editor as well as
card templates but means you can't include a BR in an escape.  If
that matters to you, define a variable in your library called "BR" and
use than in place of "&lt;br/&gt;".  No other HTML is removed, so be careful
not to style any part of an escape entered in a card editor field, and 
note that &lt; and &gt; will cause cryptic problems.
</p>

<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>
All <span class="code">*.py</span>
files (Python modules) in the <span class="code">%pluginsFolder%/CodeInCards/</span>
directory will be loaded (imported) when Anki starts.  Compile errors will be
flagged up with the normal plugin error dialog at this point.  You can reload
all libraries using "Tools&rarr;Advanced&rarr;Reload CodeInCards Libraries".
</p>

<h3 id="symbols">Symbols</h3>
<p>
Libraries should <span class="code">import CodeInCards</span>
at the top (or <span class="code">import CodeInCards as CIC</span>
for convenience).  Escapes automatically have the symbol <span class="code">CIC</span>
referring to the module, for brevity.
</p>

<p>
Escapes have access to all globals in your <a href="#libraries">libraries</a>.
The following symbols are provided by <span class="code">CIC</span>:
</p>
<dl style="margin-left:3em;">
  <dt class="code">CIC.showHTML</dt>
  <dd>If set to <span class="code">True</span> in an escape, show the resulting HTML markup instead of rendering it; this can help when debugging an escape.</dd>
  <dt class="code">CIC.QorA</dt>
  <dd>'q' or 'a', depending on which side of the card is being rendered.  You can also use just <span class="code">QorA</span> in escapes.</dd>
  <dt class="code">CIC.card</dt>
  <dd>The card being rendered; see the <a href="http://github.com/dae/libanki/blob/master/anki/cards.py">Anki source</a> for structure details.  Warning: this may be <span class="code">None</span> when a card summary is rendered in the browser!  You can also use just <span class="code">card</span> in escapes.</dd>
  <dt class="code">CIC.isSummary</dt>
  <dd><span class="code">True</span> if the card side is being rendered in the cards list, <span class="code">False</span> if it's being rendered in a preview or review.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>At the moment there's no way to prevent the escapes appearing in the browser, so cards start to look quite ugly.</li>
  <li>It's too easy to get carried away and implement your own SRS mini-language packed with syntactic sugar.</li>
</ul>
