# Comments are allowed anywhere and start with '#'.
# Trailing whitespace is discarded from all lines.

# "st: " introduces space-separated tags that apply to all facts in the file
# You could add them at import, but I prefer to do it here.

# "m: " names a model to be used for the facts that follow.
# The name must match Settings->Deck Properties->Models & Priorities->General & Fields->General->Name
m: Acronyms etc
# I find it useful to list the fields in the model.
# contraction, expansion, context, mnemonic, source

# Once a model is set, a non-blank line begins a fact.
PDGF # this will be assigned to the first field of the model
platelet-derived growth factor # and this to the second, etc
atheroma pathogenesis
. # a dot marks the end of the fact

# You don't necessarily have to give values for all fields.
# Anki might complain though if you miss one marked "prevent empty entries".
# This fact omits "context", for instance - an option field in this model.
CETP
cholesterol ester transfer protein
.

###############################
# Switch to a new model.
# The importer will add all facts for the previous model at this point (I hope to fix this one day).
# The implication is that a parse error will cause a partial import.
m: 1One-term definition
# term, definition, context, mnemonic, source

# This fact has no context or mnemonic, but it does have a source, so we need to have the empty lines.
# I'd normally use a comment to explicitly say they're empty, but that'd complicate this example.
xanthoma
a deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material in tendons and other body parts

# Fields are technically raw HTML, so as a contrived example you could say
# "macrophage" as "m…∏" with an entity reference. Let's also colour something blue.
foam cell
a macrophage (m&phi;) or <span style="color:blue;">smooth muscle cell</span> which has phagocytosed LDL and forms part of an atheroma
.

###############################
m: Palindromic
# east, west, context, mnemonic, source

# You can add a tag to just one fact by putting "t: tag1 tag2 ..." anywhere inside:
Which serum cholesterol type is the best predictor of coronary disease?
What is LDL a good predictor for?
t: clinicaltests # like this
.

###############################
m: One way
# question, answer, context, mnemonic, source

# You can also include lists in YAML format.  They'll get converted to HTML lists.
# A list element of "- t: some text" will break the list, include "some text" and restart it.
# A list element of "- I forgot this was YAML:" (trailing colon) will just ignore the ':'
# That's only noteworthy because YAML interprets it as a hash.
List the conditions in "Virchow's triad" of thrombosis risk.

- vessel wall changes (esp. atheroma)
- flow changes (esp. turbulent)
- blood composition changes (esp. platelets, fibrinogen)

# You can include multiple lines using Perlish "here document" format:
#    <<end
#    first line
#    second line
#    all into one field
#    end
#    next field
# or with backticks:
#    `first line
#    second line
#    all into one field`
#    next field

# The Perl-eqsue token __END__ ceases the import, so you can leave crap at the end.

__END__

# Not sure about this one. See http://content.onlinejacc.org/content/vol43/issue5/images/large/3016504.717.gr1.jpeg
