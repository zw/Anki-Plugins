<span style="color:red; font-size:larger;">WARNING: By its very nature, this plugin is a GAPING SECURITY HOLE - if you have it enabled and review a maliciously-crafted (or even just buggy) deck, BAD PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO BREAK/TAKE OVER YOUR COMPUTER.  Do not install this plugin unless you're certain you fully understand these implications.</span>

Loads substition "libraries" of functions and variables from <span style="font-family:Courier,monospace">%pluginsFolder%/CodeInCards/*.py</span>
