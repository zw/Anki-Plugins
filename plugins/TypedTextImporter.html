I prefer to type my items into a text editor so that I can see them all in one
or two screenfuls before I import them - that way I find my items don't overlap
or conflict with each other as much.  I don't find the existing supported
formats usable for this, and the world doesn't have nearly enough file formats,
so I rolled yet another one to meet my needs.

A commented example is probably the best documentation.  Click this <button type="button" onclick="hideImpComm()">button</button> to toggle the purely explanatory comments.  You can <a href="TypedTextImporterSample.txt">download this sample</a> if you want.

What role does LCAT play in lipid metabolism?
It converts HDL free cholesterol into HDL cholesterol esters during reverse cholesterol transport.

<p>
To speed things up slightly if you use the same file over and over again (like
I do) you can use a hotkey.  By default it's "Shift-z" i.e. "Z" (for 'Zak', because I'm
egotistical, and because Q seemed unsuitable) but you can edit the Python
source to change this.  If you hit that key the importer loads from a hard-coded
path-to-file - again, you need to edit the Python to change it.  It still opens
up an import dialog with a button.
</p>

<p>
TODO:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>make hot-key importing use a path configured with a dialog reached by a menu</li>
  <li>don't insert our importer first</li>
  <li>I'm sure this plugin violates what plugin API there is</li>
  <li>partial imports are ugly; problem is we're based on a text importer not designed for >1 model, yet I'm not comfortable creating facts directly in the DB like Anki's own importer does</li>
  <li>code is really ugly - huge functions and peppered with logging debug from development</li>
</ul>
