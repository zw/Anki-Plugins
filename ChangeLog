 * Work around Issue 12 (http://github.com/zw/Anki-Plugins/issues/issue/12)
   - evaluating escapes for browser summaries seemed to cause crashes.
   Cardlist will just have to look ugly again (i.e. show unexecuted code) for
   a while until I sort this.

v23, 2010-05-21:

 * Fix Issue 10 (http://github.com/zw/Anki-Plugins/issues/issue/10) - half-typed
   escapes in browser would cause exceptions as you typed.
